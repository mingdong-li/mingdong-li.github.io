*"Zwei Dinge erfüllen das Gemüt mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschäftigt: Der bestirnte Himmel über mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir."*

# 📖 About me
**[On Job Market]**. 

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (Robotics and Autonomous Systems) at <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies (AIS)</a> of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**), supervised by <a href="https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yiwen-wang-eewangyw">Prof. Yiwen Wang</a> (<a href="https://bmi.hkust.edu.hk/">CCEL in HKUST</a>). Before joining HKUST,  I received my M.Eng (**Zhejiang Univ.** 2021) and B.Eng (**Tongji Univ.** 2018) in Mechanical Engineering.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **brain-machine interface**, **neural science** and **artificial intelligence**. Now I focus on modeling point processes (neuronal spike trains)  for understanding neural populations in Brain-machine Interfaces. And I also did some work on brain-inspired intelligence for mechanical product design. I am broadly interested in
1. Developing interpretable methods in neuroscience for understanding how neurons are organized to represent, process and transmit information in a data-driven way
2. Building brain-inspired machine intelligence framework for bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks
3. Applications in brain-machine interface, robotics learning, wearable computers and solving questions in multiple areas, etc
