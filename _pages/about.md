*"Zwei Dinge erfüllen das Gemüt mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschäftigt: Der bestirnte Himmel über mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir."*

# 📖 About me
I am Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/">Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (Robotics and Autonomous Systems)</a> at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**), supervised by <a href="https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yiwen-wang-eewangyw">Prof. Yiwen Wang</a>. Before joined <a href="https://bmi.hkust.edu.hk/">CCEL in HKUST</a>,  I received my M.Eng (**Zhejiang Univ.** 2021) and B.Eng (**Tongji Univ.** 2018) in Mechanical Engineering.

My reserach interest lies in the intersection of neural science, neural engineering, machine learning, and robotics. Now I focus on developing conputational models based point process filter for understanding neural population activity and neural connectivity in **Brain-machine Interfaces**. And I also did some work on brain-inspired intelligence for mechanical product design.
